## Introducing Myself

My name is Raef and I am a Data Analyst/Scientist for a news and media company. I work with analytical tools and also NLP techniques to gain insights from historical data. Recently on August 2024, I have started to dive deeper into Data Engineering as I find it to be very useful for data acquisition in any data operations.
